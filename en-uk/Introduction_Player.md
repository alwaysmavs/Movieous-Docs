## Project Description

`MovieousPlayer` is a developed player researched by [movieous] (https://movieous.cn/) based on [ijkplayer] (https://github.com/bilibili/ijkplayer) . `MovieousPlayer` continued the Infinite stability and compatibility, In addition, it has made further optimization for the live broadcast scene, and supports the first screen open ASAP, cumulative delay optimization, DNS optimization, automatic switching of soft and hard encoding solutions, Etc., and also provides a smaller package. By integrating `MovieousPlayer`, developers can quickly build an excellent live broadcast and on-demand player app. `MovieousPlayer `SDK is a set of tools for fast and convenient development of mobile applications for viewing various media streams like RTMP, HLS, FLV, MP4, TS, and other network video formats and playback files with following formats: AVI, MOV, MKV, FLV, AVI, 3GP, 3G2, ASF, WMV, MP4, M4V, TP, TS, MTP, M2T, etc. The core of the SDK is a library for app development.

## Outstanding Features

## Outstanding Features

### Small package

The Movieous SDK features are basically implemented which based on the original API, reducing the size of the SDK by reducing the dependency of the tripartite library. 

### Simple API

Movieous provides the ultimate simple API to help developers quickly master. Developers don't need to master a lot of hard-to-find knowledge of audio and video codec and image processing. Just fill in a small number of configurations according to business needs to quickly integrate the SDK.

### Componentization

Like the LEGO toy, Movieous is designed to function as a standard component. The module partition is scientific and reasonable, and there is no need to face the cumbersome and expensive cycle of customized development. The customer can load the necessary functional modules as needed, and the appropriate combination of modules can be used to easily deal with complex and changing business needs.

### Network jitter optimization

In order to cope with complex network conditions, we designed a complete cache management system to alleviate the problem of network caused by network jitter.

### Low latency

Movieous and CDN partner vendors optimized the network to improve the stability of the live broadcast network.

### Document specification

Movieous will update the development documentation synchronously to ensure that new features are delivered to the customer accurately.

### High scalability

The Movieous architecture adopts a framework based on "framework" to embed plug-ins. Users can easily expand their own beautification, filter and other services based on the existing Movieous SDK .

### Professional and personal service to respond quickly to troubles and requirements.

The members of Movieous are from the first-tier audio and video team at domestic and abroad. They have rich experience in audio and video development. The senior technical engineers and R&D provide a prefessional technical support to customers from trial to be the business customer. Efficiently responds To troubles and requirements. Technical docking has no worries.
