## Outstanding Features

### Small package

The Movieous SDK features are basically implemented which based on the original API, reducing the size of the SDK by reducing the dependency of the tripartite library. 

### Simple API

Movieous provides the ultimate simple API to help developers quickly master. Developers don't need to master a lot of hard-to-find knowledge of audio and video codec and image processing. Just fill in a small number of configurations according to business needs to quickly integrate the SDK.

Like the LEGO toy, Movieous is designed to function as a standard component. The module partition is scientific and reasonable, and there is no need to face the cumbersome and expensive cycle of customized development. The customer can load the necessary functional modules as needed, and the appropriate combination of modules can be used to easily deal with complex and changing business needs.

### Network jitter optimization

In order to cope with complex network conditions, we designed a complete cache management system to alleviate the problem of network caused by network jitter.

### Low latency
